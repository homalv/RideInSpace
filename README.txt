
RIDE IN SPACE
Instructions for building and testing:

The game is developed on Windows using Visual Studio Code. 
The program is compiled with a makefile located in the root directory along with the other folders. 
The include directory contains all the header files, and the src directory contains all the cpp files, including the main file. 
The resources directory contains sound files, image files, and fonts in their respective subdirectories. 
These resources are necessary to run the game.

The Game:
The game is a classic model consisting of a spaceship (the player) that travels from left to right while enemy ships come from the opposite direction and shoot at the player. 
The player's ship is moved with the arrow keys and shoots with the space bar. 
The player has three lives, which decrease each time they are hit by either enemy fire or a collision with enemy ships. 
There is also a scoreboard that counts how many enemy ships the player has shot down. 
One point is awarded for each enemy ship shot down. When three lives are lost, the game ends, and the player is offered the option to restart or exit the game.

The goal is to score as many points as possible.
